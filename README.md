# Farming Party for Elder Scrolls Online

A simple addon that aggregates the items your group gets while farming and provides notifications and a leaderboard based upon [Arkadius' Trade Tools](http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1752-ArkadiusTradeTools.html), [Master Merchant](http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info928-MasterMerchant.html), or [Tamriel Trade Centre](http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1245-TamrielTradeCentre.html) pricing values.

Originally based upon [Group Loot](http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1027-GroupLoot.html) by Temeez.
